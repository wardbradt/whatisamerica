"What is America?" was my final project for my 11th grade History 300 (AP US History) class. I sought to create a project that would represent the values of American society while nourishing my interest in computer science. The coding is fairly amateur, as I had seven days to learn HTML, CSS, and PHP; create the website; and work on five other final examinations. “What is America” seeks to represent the values of American society by offering a platform for anyone to freely express their views of America in a one-sentence link, quote, or thought.
